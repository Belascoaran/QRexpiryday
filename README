An Android application that reads the BarCode of the items and stores the information. The information can be like Name, Type, Expiry date. 
There is no manual entry of the Expiry date in to the app. 
Features:

1) Login feature - reads the bar code of the universal membership card and uses that as the login information
2) Retrieves all the purchasing information that is attached with the card and checks the expiry date for each. 
3) Gives out an alarm every day starting from 5 days before the expiry date. This setting is left to the user.
4) More features are being worked upon....... :) (few of the things are stil under construction.. :p)
